# Shopping-List

Shopping List. Make a list of anything you want and it will be on a page even after refresh as it will be saved in your local storage. 
Made by following @wesbos's course 'Beginner Javascript'.

Uses: **HTML5, CSS, JS**.

In this project I practiced my JavaScript skills. Learned how to use custom events, event delegation and how to use local storage.
